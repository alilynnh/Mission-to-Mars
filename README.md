# Mission to Mars
## Overview of Project
The current project involved creating a web app that scrapes for and displays the following:
1. The title and caption of a recent news article about Mars
2. A featured Mars image 
3. Facts about Mars and Earth
4. Full-resolution images of all four of Mars' hemispheres. 

The project was completed using MongoDB, Flask, BeautifulSoup, and Splinter. 

## Modifications
Once the basic information was gathered onto the web app, modifications were made that enhanced the appearance and flexibility of the app on mobile and desktop platforms. 

More specifically, the following changes were made: 
- Adjusted the grid so the hemisphere images are more compact, but do not crowd each other on mobile. 
- The rows of the Mars Facts table are highlighted upon mouse hover. 
- General background and header background colors were changed. 
- Button color was changed, and vibrancy increases upon mouse hover.
